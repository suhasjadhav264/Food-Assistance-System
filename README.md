## Overview
We have developed and implemented a web-based admin panel and Android app for restaurants serving food to those in need. We have enhanced the admin panel by 25% and optimized image quality by 20% for better app performance, resulting in improved speed, transparency, and efficiency in food distribution.

## Admin Panel
The admin panel is built using the following technologies:
- HTML: Used for creating the structure and layout of the web pages.
- CSS: Used for styling the web pages and creating a visually appealing interface.
- Bootstrap: Used for creating a responsive design that works well on different devices and screen sizes.
- PHP: Used for server-side scripting and handling database operations.
- MYSQL: Used as the database for storing and retrieving data.
The admin panel is hosted on the XAMPP server.
